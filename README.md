# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
In this analysis, we discovered the total amount of employees leaving the company, narrowed down to the most recent title they've held, as well as established who among them would be eligible to participate in a mentorship program to help train their replacements.

## Results
The results from the analysis are:
* Among the retiring employees, many hold senior positions, such as Senior Engineer.
* Of those retiring titles, only two are held by managers.
* Many of these employees have moved up through the ranks of the company over the years, showing loyalty to a well-managed company with corresponding benefits and it would behoove to continue to foster this, especially in the mentorship program.
* Many of the retirees are in a good position to mentor, as a common title among the list is "Technique Leader", showing that they have experience learning information and then disseminating it to lower levels of staff.

## Summary
The total number of employees retiring is: 90,398. This is made up of senior engineers, senior staff, engineers, staff, technique leaders, assistant engineers, and managers.
